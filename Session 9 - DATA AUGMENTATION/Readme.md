# EVA5 - WEEK 8 Assignment #

## Assignment: ##
1. Go through this repository: https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar
2. Extract the ResNet18 model from this repository and add it to your API/repo. 
3. Use your data loader, model loading, train, and test code to train ResNet18 on Cifar10
4. Your Target is 85% accuracy. No limit on the number of epochs. Use default ResNet18 code (so params are fixed). 

## Below are the Training Details  ##
### Parameters and Hyperparameters ###
1. Loss Function: Cross Entropy Loss 
2. Optimizer: SGD
3. Learning Rate: 0.01
4. LR Step Size: 25
5. LR Gamma: 0.1
6. Batch Size: 64
7. num_workers = 4 
8. Epochs: 55
9. Data Augmentation

### The following data augmentation techniques were applied to the dataset during training: ###
Random Rotation: 15 degrees
Random Horizontal Flip

### the accurcay of 85% was reached in the 48th Epoch. ###
